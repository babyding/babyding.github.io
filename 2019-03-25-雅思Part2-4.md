### 1. Describe a language you want to learn(not English)

&emsp;&emsp;A language I would like to learn would be Spanish. 

&emsp;&emsp;Spanish is one of the leading languages in the world. This language is spoken in over 20 countries and it is also the official second language in the USA. Nowadays, a number of people are able to get engaged in various types of activities after learning Spanish.

&emsp;&emsp;I would like the lessons to be taught in my home and the lessons would be face-to-face communication. I would like the teacher to just let me speak，and then check my pronunciation of individual words and sentences. Also，I would like this tutor to be strict and force me to study，but I don’t want the tutor to discourage me，so I hope that he’s skilled at the art of encouragement and motivation.


&emsp;&emsp; I want to learn this language because I am quite into Spain, and I hope one day I could have the chance to live and work in Spain. So this language is so obviously important to me and would be beneficial for me to communicate with the local people there. There’s no doubt that being fluent in Spanish would make my opportunities grow. You know, if my Spanish is very good, I can have more opportunities to participate in various types of activities.

### 2. Describe a good law in your country

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;Like in most countries, in China there’s the trafﬁc law, the newly updated version brought bigger beneﬁts to the society. The new trafﬁc law was adapted last year, I think…which gives harsher punishment to people who does drunken driving—their license will be revoked immediately, and they could even face criminal charges. 

**(2)How**

&emsp;&emsp;I knew about this law was because I have been preparing for the driving license test. 

**(3)Who it affects**

&emsp;&emsp;I think anyone living in China can be affected by this law, not only the drivers but also the pedestrians on the roads.  

**(4)Why**

&emsp;&emsp;The biggest reason that I would consider this law to be a beneﬁcial one is that it sends out a clear message that DUI is intolerable in China. I remember in the past before the law wasn’t so complete there were people take chances on after they drink. It caused numerous amounts of trafﬁc accidents every year. I think this behavior was quite irresponsible both to themselves and to other people.

&emsp;&emsp;The other positive change is that the police force that has been sent on catching DUIs were increased signiﬁcantly. Every nights there’re police checking on main roads, intercept people for alcohol tests. I guess this action intimidates drunk drivers as well. 

### 3. Describe the last book you read

**(1)What type**

&emsp;&emsp;The book I am going to tell you is called"The Three-body problem".It is science fiction written by Liu cixin，who is a famous writer in China.The book was published in 2006 and won the science fiction achievement award.


**(2)What was**

&emsp;&emsp;The story happened between the earth and an alien civilization called the three-body.Unlike the typical American movie where the alien suddenly invaded the earth and the earth army fought back，the three-body blocked the earth's scientific progress and sponsored a group of people who welcomed them.In the end，a person found something that could threaten the alien's survival, so finally they agreed to coexist with the human on earth.

**(3)Where read**

&emsp;&emsp;I read this book on my way to Neimenggu.It was a long train journey which took 25 hours.To avoid being bored，I bought this book at the train station and finished it on the train.

**(4)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;After reading this book，my feelings were quite complicated.I am glad that the two civilizations finally accept each other and live peacefully on earth and I cannot imagine what would happen if one side finds a solution to destroy the other side.


### 4. Describe an interesting talk or lecture

**(1)When and where**

&emsp;&emsp;I am going to talk about an interesting lecture that I heard 5 years ago.It is still vivid in my mind.Back then I was eager to improve my English and my teacher recommended a lot of materials and websites，which might be useful.One of them is TED，a website where various people share their experience，research，and knowledge.Its motto is"ideas worth spreading".

**(2)What**

&emsp;&emsp;I spent a great deal of time on it.Every day，I browsed through hundreds of lectures，trying to find something that aroused my interest.Then I found one lecture that ranked first at the list of the most played.

&emsp;&emsp;It is about how people's attention works.Every day，our brain receives enormous information，most of which is useless.So during the process of evolution，our brain has gradually developed a filter mechanism.It rules out a lot of things unconsciously so that we can focus on a specific issue.However，the drawback of this mechanism is that it disables us from doing two things at the same time.

**(3)Why**

&emsp;&emsp;The interesting-thing about this lecture is that the-lecturer illustrates this by showing how picking pocket works.Through distracting people and making them focus on what he is saying，he takes belongings from them without being noticed.It was amazing.


### 5. Describe something given to you that you really need

**(1)What, who and why**

&emsp;&emsp;I borrowed a Sony Playstation 4 from my friend Zhenghao on my birthday. That day I was about to throw a birthday party at my house, one thing got my friends excited about was to come and play the PS4 game which named Call Of Duty. However I discovered my PS4 was not working! I tried restart it for many times it wouldn’t turn on. 

&emsp;&emsp;So I had to call my friend Zhenghao to borrow his set. Zhenghao just bought a newest version of PS4, named Playstation 4 pro, so I asked help from him. I was very grateful for his timely help. That night we played a lot of PS4 games , and after the party I returned it back on time. 

**(2)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;I was quite grateful to Zhenghao because he saved my day. I think he’s such a good friend to me. 


### 6. Describe a historical period that you are interested in

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;The historical period that I found particularly interesting is the Opium War, it’s also called the trade war. 

**(2)How know**

&emsp;&emsp;I learned about this history in high school, it’s part of the contemporary Chinese history course. Few years later I also watched a documentary about this war so it actually aroused my interests in this period of time.

**(3)What happened**

&emsp;&emsp;The period of history happened in the mid-19th century and the fight was between the Qing government and the British. Basically, the British forced to open Chinese trade market by smuggling opiums in, and then started the war. It didn’t end well for the Qing’s government—they signed up treaties to sell lands (gave Hong Kong the UK); people got addicted into smoking opiums, and the economy status of China had fallen far behind. 

**(4)Why**

&emsp;&emsp;In the future I think I’d like to know more about this history, especially in how the British view this period. Coz I think history should be independent and non-biased, so I quite like to see it from a British viewpoint that how would they evaluate the war. 
Also if possible I’d like to go see the opium war museum in Guangdong. To see the canons that’s been used in the war, and to pay tribute to the hero that contributed to the country. 

### 7. Describe a skill that took you a long time to learn

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;The skill which took me a lot of time to learn is snorkeling.Snorkeling is kind of a practice for real swimming in the sea.

**（2）When and who**

&emsp;&emsp;I remember it was the time after graduation that I went to Phuket Island in Thailand with my classmates for vocation.I got to know about this sport from our tour guide.

&emsp;&emsp;In order to make sure that everyone of us could swim in the sea and nobody would accidentally get injured because of lack of practice，our tour guide gave us a roughly two-hour training in a huge swimming pool on that small island.

**（3）How**

&emsp;&emsp;To snorkel，you have to be equipped with a kind of diving mask with a long tube that enables you to breathe the air in the water.Honestly，I was a little scared because I seldom swam before，not to mention diving in the water just with a help of a tube.You know，my tour guide was extremely nice.He helped me conquer the fear by teaching me how to snorkel step by step.Then，I followed his advice to practice every single step time and time again.It took me almost the entire two hours to master it.I felt it's really worthwhile and I really appreciate his guidance.

**（4）Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;Well，I think snorkeling was not that really hard after I learned how to let go our inner fear.From that on，snorkeling has been one of my favorite outdoor sports in my life.


### 8. Describe an important plant in your country

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;Speaking of a kind of plant in my country, I would like to tell you about the plum blossom. 

**(2)What looks like**

&emsp;&emsp;Basically it’s a kind of ﬂower that comes out only during the winter time, while everything else looks dull and depressed. Plum blossom trees are not very tall, I would say it’s the similar size of a cherry blossom tree. The colour of this ﬂower is much lighter, usually is in white and baby pink. When you stay closer you can smell the refreshing fragrance. 

**(3)Where**

&emsp;&emsp;I remember when I was a student, our school had a big garden with many plum blossom trees. So during the winter time students and local residents would come here and take photos.

**(4)Why**

&emsp;&emsp;The reason that I really like this kinds of plant is because of its special meanings..In China, plum blossoms are considered as a symbol of ﬁrmness. As it comes out at the winter time while other plants can’t ﬁght the cold temperature. I guess that’s also the reason that our school planted this ﬂower.. just to encourage us to be tough and strong. 

### 9. Describe a film or TV program that made you laugh

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;A TV program that made me laugh was called Happy Camp. 

**(2)When and who**

&emsp;&emsp;It's a popular entertainment show that is broadcasted every Saturday evening from 8pm to 10pm. I often watch this show because it's quite interesting. There are 5 hosts and they have really funny personalities. This program usually invites some famous celebrities to their show and not just Chinese stars but famous people from all over the world including Korean pop stars or NBA players. On this show the hosts would talk about interesting things or play jokes on the guests. They also play games, some of which can get a little bit crazy like a water gun fight and sometimes the water even hits the audience.

**(3)Why**

&emsp;&emsp;What made me laugh is the humorous language style. Watching programs like this can make me fully relaxed and improve my mood. I hope I could watch more shows like Happy Camp and since today is Saturday I will watch it tonight.

### 10. Describe a time that a piece of equipment of yours was broken(such as TV)

**(1)What, when and why**

&emsp;&emsp;I really want to say something about my Sony Playstation 4, which is different from the computer. This machine is designed for some big games.

&emsp;&emsp;That day I was about to throw a birthday party at my house, one thing got my friends excited about was to come and play the PS4 game which named Call Of Duty. However I discovered my PS4 was not working! I tried restart it for many times, but it wouldn’t turn on. 

**(2)who and what did**

&emsp;&emsp;So I had to call my friend Zhenghao to borrow his set. Zhenghao just bought a newest version of PS4, named Playstation 4 pro, so I asked help from him. We played a lot of PS4 games that night, and after the party I returned it back on time. 

**(3)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;I was quite grateful to Zhenghao because he saved my day. I think he’s such a good friend to me. 

### 11. Describe a family business you know

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;The family business that I know of is a big media giant, the Murdock family. 

**(2)What**

&emsp;&emsp;This company has been existed over half a century, the major department is controlled by Murdock and his family members, just like the 21st Fox group. The Murdock news group is a giant in media industry as their networks cover all sorts of media—the newspaper like Times and the SUN; TV network like the Sky news. 

**(3)How know and feel**

&emsp;&emsp;I got to know this company because I watched a documentary about Rupert Murdock. I could say I quite admire him although he’s a controversial character. He likes taking risks when it comes to investing in the media business, like moving to the US market, or purchasing the UK newspapers. He was right on the edge several times, but he insisted on doing what he thinks is right for the company, and luckily he survived in all of that. The other feeling I had for this family business is that I think it’s a safe way to inherited the family wealth. Murdock and his sons got over 30% control of the family so it’s difﬁcult for outsiders to make moves against the company.

### 12. Describe a newly built facility(such as parks, cinemas etc.) that influences your city.

**(1)What and where**

&emsp;&emsp;Speaking of an interesting public place in my hometown, I would like to talk about a big theme park which was newly built in my hometown. This place is quite near to the place where I live. It's probably ten minutes'walk from my home to the park.

**(2)What facility**

&emsp;&emsp;The theme park has lots of new entertainment facilities like roller coasters, or drop towers; they’ve also managed to design an entertainment zone next to the park. After the ﬁrst time I went there with my friends, I was fascinated by it. From that on, I have often come to this park. Sometimes to play on the machine, sometimes just sit on the lawn and watching ducks swimming. 

**(2)How**

&emsp;&emsp;The biggest reason I like this place is that it provides people with a mysterious and romantic feeling. Like when you enter the park, you can either choose to walk through the woods or take the magic train. It feels like the train is running on top of the woods and almost could reach the sky.

&emsp;&emsp;Another reason I like this park is the natural habitat. They hired professional gardeners to design the park, so every different season you would see different flowers with different colours.

&emsp;&emsp;I think this is why this park is so popular in my hometown. 

### 13. Describe a kind of food people eat during a special event

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;The occasion I tried a special food was the time I had a welsh cake. 

**(2)How and why**

&emsp;&emsp;Last month was my birthday, so I held a birthday party and invited a lot of friends. Some of them brought other people to the party and one of the friend is a Welsh girl. She brought a box of homemade Welsh cake to the party. That was the ﬁrst time I have ever tried a welsh cake. 

**(3)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;The reason that I think this welsh cake is quite special is because of its taste. It tastes like a scone, but she added cinnamon and raisins into it, so it makes the ﬂavor a bit more complicated. Apart that, the texture of this Welsh cake is very creamy. The cake just melted in my mouth when I took the first bite. It’s such a perfect match with a cup of English tea. Another reason I think it’s special is because it’s homemade. Baking cakes for me is too energy wasting and almost impossible to ﬁnish. You know，I was pretty thankful that my friend sent me this cake as a gift.

### 14. Describe an item you bought but do not often use

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;Speaking of something I bought but don’t use often, I’d like to tell you about my coffee maker.

**(2)When and where**

&emsp;&emsp;I can’t really remember the exact time, I think I got it from a shopping mall a few months ago when I was waiting for my friend there, the salesman made a really good speech about it.

**(3)Why bought**

&emsp;&emsp;The reason why I bought this machine is pretty straightforward—I love drinking coffee. I have to drink at least two cups of coffee everyday so I thought with this machine at home I could save some money by making coffee on my own.  

**(4)Why didn't use**

&emsp;&emsp;However, I didn’t anticipate that this expensive machine is going to sit there and eat dust on my shelf. The biggest reason is that it takes me ages to make one coffee. It’s a semi-automatic machine so that I have to grind the coffee beans, switch the button under the device, and set the temperature all by myself! Not mentioning I have to clean the machine after making a coffee. I usually make coffee in the morning so there’s absolutely no way I can make it on time. 

&emsp;&emsp;The other reason is that the taste is not even that good. I tried many times, even changed different coffee beans but the feeling is still unsatisfying. I think I can get much better coffee at Starbucks. So that’s the reason why I don’t use this machine often. 

### 15. Describe a book you want to write

**(1)What kind**

&emsp;&emsp;A book I want to write is an autobiography，which can reflect my trajectory and meaning of life.

**(2)When and what difficult**

&emsp;&emsp;The time I had this idea of writing was after I finished a course about autobiography last semester. Initially，I thought this course would be bored，coz to my view at that time，I thought nobody could write a good autobiography except for the well-known writer. However，my understanding was totally wrong after I took this amazing course. Our professor showed us how to write a biography step by step and she told us that everyone was unique and special in his or her life story.

&emsp;&emsp;Just as an American education philosopher said，"life is like one damn thing after another".So，I think the most difficult thing to write a good autobiography would be that I need to experience more obstacles in lives and try to understand them so that I could get things to write.

**(3)Why**

&emsp;&emsp;Well，I have always wanted to experience more in life. And to write an autobiography would help me keep a record of them. I think this is the main reason why I want to write an autobiography.

### 16. Describe a subject you used to dislike but now have interest in

**(1)What and why dislike**

&emsp;&emsp;Speaking the subject I didn’t like before but have interest in now, I’d like to say English. I least favourite this subject when I was in primary school. Back then, I got a bad score in one English test, and my English teacher, Mrs Zhang, was angry with me. That afternoon, she told me that I had no talent in English, and she announced this thing in front of my classmates, which made me very ashamed. From that time on, I somehow couldn' t pick up my interest in English. It might be the reason that my English teacher was extremely harsh to me, which was quite discouraging and made me feel sick about learning English.

**(2)What and why interested**

&emsp;&emsp;But now, I am more and more interested in English. I think the main reason why I become interested in this subject is that I have realized the power of this language. First of all, I think English is very important in modern society, it just like a communication bridge. For example, I can hear English no matter where I am，and if I want to talk with other people who were not Chinese, I would use English to let them understand me. It is really convenient. On the other hand, I would like to study abroad. The school that I wanna go to ask me to offer an IELTS score. So I have to learn it well. I think this is the main reason why I am interested in English now.


### 17. Describe a present you received which was made by hand

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;A gift that I received which was made by hand was a Welsh cake, which was given by a Welsh girl.

**(1)When and who**

&emsp;&emsp;Last month was my birthday, so I held a birthday party and invited a lot of friends. Some of them brought other people to the party and one of the friend is a Welsh girl. She brought a box of homemade Welsh cake to the party. That was the ﬁrst time I have ever tried a welsh cake. 

**(3)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;The reason that I think this welsh cake is quite special is because of its taste. It tastes like a scone, but she added cinnamon and raisins into it, so it makes the ﬂavor a bit more complicated. Besides, the texture of this Welsh cake is very creamy. The cake just melted in my mouth when I took the first bite. It’s such a perfect match with a cup of English tea. Another reason why I think it’s special is because it’s homemade. Baking cakes for me is too energy wasting and almost impossible to ﬁnish.You know，I was pretty thankful that my friend sent me this homemade cake as a gift.

### 18. Describe something lost by others but found by you

**(1)when and who**

&emsp;&emsp;I’d like to talk about the time when I found the school ID card lost by my classmate. It happened in the last semester. That day I planned to make a revision of my homework so I went to the library. When I sat down at the table, I found that there was a student ID card left on the desk. School ID card is really important for everyone coz without it, you will not be able to enter the library or the dorm. So I thought the person who lost it must be very upset.

**(2)How find**

&emsp;&emsp;Luckily, basic information of the student was recorded on the card, so it was easy to know who was the owner. I took a photo of the card and then posted it on the website attached with my phone number. And after about half an hour, the owner contacted me. At last, the card was back to her successfully.

**(3)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;As for how I felt about this experience, well, first of all I was quite delighted. The owner was so excited when receiving the card. You know the feeling of helping others and seeing smile appearing on her face is really beyond description. What’s more, I found out that life nowadays is far more convenient than before because of the development of modern technology. I guess it might take at least a week to find the owner in the past, but now it only takes half an hour.

### 19. Describe something you do to help you study or work

**(1)what**

&emsp;&emsp;Something I do to help me study or work is actually to do meditation. I think it’s the best way to empty your mind and to decompress. Meditation is a kind of technique that I could use to focus my mind on certain things. I think it is similar to yoga.

&emsp;&emsp;There was a meditation camp held last year in my city, so I joined that camp and learned how to do meditation.

&emsp;&emsp;Now, I do meditation almost everyday, once before bed and once when I get up. It won’t take me long, about 5 to 10 minutes is enough. I downloaded an app so it’s quite simple for me that I just need to sit tight and follow the instructions. 

**(2)Why interesting**

&emsp;&emsp;So far, I have found this method to be very effective and can help me train my attentions. I need to keep my mind clear coz I have lots of work to do everyday and I don't want to be easily distracted. In the morning after the meditation I would feel more energetic; at night before bed if I feel anxious, this’s also a good way to calm myself down. So,I will definitely keep using this way to improve the quality of my life in the future.
