## 第二部分 问答题思路与拓展

### 1. 什么是雅思口语问答题

- Part1 & Part3 -考官提问
- Part2 自问自答

---

### 2. Part1 vs Part3 答题区别

- Part1: Show your ability to **understand** the question and **extend** your answers

- Part3: Able to **give opinion** and **justify** your opinion


**举例1：What kinds of gifts are popular in your country?**

	A. Well stuff like digital products are quite popular, 
	   like speakers, or cellphones, coz they’re useful and pricy. 
	   Also, decorative things like flowers or vases are good choices. 

	B.（1）Among family and friends gifts that are practical are more popular, 
	      like gift cards, so that they can buy whatever they want. 
	      Coz families know each other well there’s no need to overthink.
	  （2）But for some important people may be sending gifts 
	      that are more expensive and meaningful is a better choice. 

	第二个更好

**举例2：How do you feel when you’re in a crowded place? **

	A. I feel angry…coz there’re too many people…and worried, I don’t like people. 

	B. I feel dysphoric, coz of all the hustle and bustles of the city. 
	   I don’t like to stay in a place where swamp with people. 
	   Like last time I went to a restaurant I saw lots of people, I went away immediately. 

	C. Normally I would feel quite agitated…
	   coz I don’t like to stay among many people. 
	   Like if I see a big crowd at the restaurant, 
	   I would immediately turn around and go away. 
  
 	第三个更好

#### 3.1 听起来更口语化
