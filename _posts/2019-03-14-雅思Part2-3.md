### 1. Describe a time you borrowed something from your friends or family

**(1)What, when and why**

&emsp;&emsp;I borrowed a xbox from my friend Tony on my birthday. That day I was about to throw a birthday party at my house, one thing got my friends excited about was to come and play the Xbox game which named Guitar Heros. However I discovered my xbox is not working! I tried restart it for many times it wouldn’t turn on. 

**(2)who and what did**

&emsp;&emsp;So I had to call my friend Tony to borrow his set. Tony just bought this newest version of Xbox, so I asked help from him. We played a lot of xbox games that night, and after the party I returned it back on time. I was quite grateful to Tony because he saved my day. I think he’s such a good friend to me. 

### 2. Describe a game that you played in your childhood

**(1)What**

&emsp;&emsp;My favorite childhood game I’d like to talk about is called the Sardine. This game is essentially the backward version of hide and seek—only one player hides while others go hunting individually. Then, when a hunter ﬁnds the hiding player, instead of announcing it, that player gets into the hiding place with them. When more and more people settle into the original hiding place, the place would get packed, just like sardine. 

**(2)When and who**

&emsp;&emsp;I liked playing this game with my friends—when we squeezed together we couldn’t stop giggling, then someone would ﬁnd us through laughter. It’s also exciting that we had to hold our breath when someone was looking for us. I think it’s such a great game for us to enjoy ourselves. When I was a child there’s not much activity for children to choose, and my parents were quite busy, so I was lucky that the neighboring kids are around my age so that we could spend lots of quality time together. 

**(3)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;Now when I look back I felt amazed about the kid’s world—every little place could become a hiding spot for children, and I was able to discover the most secret and hidden place for us to stay. 

### 3. Describe an important decision made with the help of other people

**(1)When**

&emsp;&emsp;The important decision I am going to tell you happened in my senior high school.Back then I was faced with the problem of the division of arts and sciences.According to the Chinese educational system，everyone had to choose one as his or her major and this would affect the subjects he or she took in the university entrance exam.If you choose the sciences，you need to study physics，chemistry，and biology，and if you choose the arts，you need to study geography，politics，-and history.

**(2)Who and what decision**

&emsp;&emsp;I was so confused and did not know which one is better，so I went to my teacher and asked for her advice.This article is from Laokaoya website.Do not copy or repost it.As I was good at all the subjects，she suggested me to choose the sciences.She said that at this stage of my life，I would not know what I wanted to do in the future.If I had chosen the sciences，I could still change into arts degrees in the university.But if I had chosen the arts，it would almost beimpossible to study the sciences because of the lack of background knowledge.I thought her words did make a sense and followed her advice.

**(3)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;It turned out that I had made a good decision. When I chose the universities and majors after the exam,I could choose almost whatever I want.I am really grateful to my teacher.

### 4. Describe a time that you had to change your plan or change your mind

**(1)When**

&emsp;&emsp;The thing that I had to change my plan happened in my senior high school.Back then I was faced with the problem of the division of arts and sciences.According to the Chinese educational system，everyone had to choose one as his or her major and this would affect the subjects he or she took in the university entrance exam.If you choose the sciences，you need to study physics，chemistry，and biology，and if you choose the arts，you need to study geography，politics，-and history.

**(2)What made you change and nwe plan**

&emsp;&emsp;I was so confused and did not know which one is better，so I went to my teacher and asked for her advice.This article is from Laokaoya website.Do not copy or repost it.As I was good at all the subjects，she suggested me to choose the sciences.She said that at this stage of my life，I would not know what I wanted to do in the future.If I had chosen the sciences，I could still change into arts degrees in the university.But if I had chosen the arts，it would almost beimpossible to study the sciences because of the lack of background knowledge.I thought her words did make a sense and followed her advice.

### 5. Describe a time when you received money as a present

**(1)Who**

&emsp;&emsp;Actually being a Chinese it’s quite common to receive money as present. People would give out cash on various occasions like birthdays, the Spring Festivals, but I’d like to share with a meaningful time in my life—the time my grandmother gave me some money on before I set off to university. 

**(2)When**

&emsp;&emsp;After I got admitted into the University, my family held a big. They invited all the family member to come. On the party my grandmother gave me a red envelope, it was some cash. She told me she’s been waiting for this moment to hand me her gift. I didn’t open it ﬁrst as it’s a Chinse courtesy not to open gift in front of others. 


**(3)What**

&emsp;&emsp;After the party’s over I was surprised to ﬁnd that she gave me about 6000 yuan, that’s a lot of money for an old person. I saved the money in the bank coz I didn’t know what to buy with it, and I thought it’s my grandmother’s kindness, so I didn’t want to waste it. 

**(4)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;The feeling that I had for this gift was thrills—I didn’t expect my grandma would give me that much money, I thought receiving the blessings from her was quite enough. She’s retired and that money must come from her savings, so I decided to save it instead of spend on clothes or bags. The other feeling was that I think this gift was quite warm, coz the number she gave me was 6,000 yuan, 6 is a lucky number in Chinese culture, so it means that she wishes me a bright and lucky future. That’s quite sweet and thoughtful of her. 

### 6. Describe a party that you joined

**(1)What kind, where and when**

&emsp;&emsp;The most memorable party in my life should be the party that we held last year. It was held to celebrate our reunion after we went to university. And It was held in my friend’s home. A lot of my high school classmates attended the party. I arrived at my classmate's home very early to help him prepare the dinner.

&emsp;&emsp;Since most of us hadn’t seen each other for nearly half a year after our graduation from the high school, we were really excited to know each other’s status quo. 

&emsp;&emsp;After the meal, we played cards, sang songs, and chatted with each other to wxchange our wonderful experiences and so on. Later, we went to KTV to sing songs. We were screaming and laughing, and a lot of us got drunk. 

**(2)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;It was really awesome, and we made a decision to have that kind of get-together every half a year.

### 7. Describe an activity you would do when you are alone in your free time

**(1)What**
The activity I would do when I am alone and free is to play a computer game called the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.It is a turn-based tactical role-playing simulation grandstrategy wargame produced by Koei.Thirteen installments of the game have been published since 1985 and my favorite one is the 11th.

**(2)How often**
I usually play it on the Sunday afternoon when I have finished all my homework.But this is not fixed.If I am bored，I may turn on the computer and play for one or two hours even duringthe weekdays.There are also some times that I am so busy that I do not touch it for a month. The frequency highly depends on my daily routine.

**(3)Who**

It is a console game and the AI would play my enemies.So I do not need a partner or anopponent.But there was a time when my friends and I compete with each other to see who would be the first to unify the country.

**(4)Why**

The game is based on a period of real history in China when numerous heroes fought against each other and left their legends.By playing this game，you can change their destiny and experience their lives.That is why I like playing it when I am alone in my spare time.

### 8. Describe a time when you looked for information from the internet

**(1)When**

Well, as far as I can remember, the last time I looked for information online was when I prepared for my trip to Wuhan. I went to Wuhan for vacation last month, so I had to plan everything prior to my upcoming trip so I would not be disoriented when I got there.

**(2)What**

The information I looked for was our accommodation choices, good food in Wuhan, tourist attractions and safety information. All of those information was of vital importance to prepare for a wonderful traveling experience.

I used Google to search the information coz the results are more reliable and various than other search engines. Also, I found a lot of information on Xiecheng, a major tourism-related website that provides tips and suggestions for international travelers.

**(3)How**

As for how I felt about it, it was really convenient for me to find what I need without leaving my house. I could know a lot of things about Wuhan while searching for information to prepare for my trip. I was very grateful that I could get assess to the Internet, which made me feel really confident and well-prepared for my trip.

### 9. Describe a complaint that you made and you were satisfied with the result

**（1）When**

The complaint I am going to tell you happened a few months ago. I found I had spent too much money on my cell phone, so I decided to degrade the package.

**（2）Who**

When I called the customer service of the operating company，the representative said thatI could upgrade my package any time I wanted，but if I wanted to degrade it，I had to wait until next year. It was totally absurd.But no matter what I said，the staff insisted that this was the regulation and there was no room for negotiation.I called several times.Every representative gave the same answer.

**（3）What**

I was enraged.I called the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology，which is a government body supervising all the mobile operating companies.I explained what happened in details and why I thought this was unfair.AfterI submitting it，the representative said it would give me a reply in 7 working days.

**（4）Why satisfied**

In fact，it did not take that long.On the second day，the company's customer service called.He said he was the manager of the relevant department and was sorry about the inconvenience his colleagues had caused.The package of my number was degraded immediately.I was satisfied with his attitude and the result.

### 10. Describe an outdoor sport you played for the first time

**（1）What**

One of the outdoor sports I played for the first time was snorkeling when I was abroad for traveling.

**（2）When and who**

I remember it was the time after graduation that I went to Phuket Island in Thailand with my classmates for vocation.I got to know about this sport from our tour guide who led us to a small tourist island for sightseeing.

Snorkeling is kind of a practice for real swimming in the sea.In order to make sure that everyone one of us in the touring group could swim in the sea and that nobody would accidentally get injured because of lack of practice，our tour guide Jack gave us a roughly two-hour training in a huge swimming pool of a villa on that small island.

**（3）How**

To snorkel，you have to be equipped with a kind of diving mask with a long tube that enables you to breathe the air in the water.Honestly，this article is from Laokaoya website，I was a little scared because I seldom swam before，not to mention diving in the water just with a help of a tube.You know，Jack was extremely nice.He helped me conquer the fear by teaching me how to snorkel step by step.I saw his movement was so natural，and mine was like a zombie.Then，I followed his advice to practice every single step time and time again.It took me almost the entire two hours to master it.I felt it's really worthwhile and I really appreciate his guidance.

**（4）Feel**

Well，I think snorkeling was not that really hard after I learned how to let go in terms of our inner fear.From that on，snorkeling has been one of my favorite outdoor sport in my life.

### 11. Describe a piece of good news you heard (from TV or the Internet)

**（1）What**

Well,I'd like to talk about the news about the traffic law in China.Like in most countries, in China there’s the trafﬁc law, the newly updated version brought bigger beneﬁts to the society. 

**（2）When**

The new trafﬁc law was adapted last year, I think…which gives harsher punishment to people who does drunken driving—their license will be revoked immediately, and they could even face criminal charges. 

**（3）Where**

I knew about this law was because I have been preparing for the driving license test. 
I think anyone living in China can be affected by this law, not only the drivers but also the pedestrians on the roads.  

**（3）Why**

The biggest reason that I would consider this law to be a beneﬁcial one is that it sends out a clear message that DUI is intolerable in China. I remember in the past before the law wasn’t so complete there were people take chances on after they drink. It caused numerous amounts of trafﬁc accidents every year. I think this behavior was quite irresponsible both to themselves and to other people.
The other positive change is that the police force that has been sent on catching DUIs were increased signiﬁcantly. Every nights there’re police checking on main roads, intercept people for alcohol tests. I guess this action intimidates drunk drivers as well. 

### 12. Describe a time that someone didn't tell you the whole truth about something

**（1）When**

The time that I almost got tricked was the time my cousin tried to fool me. 
Last year I had a short stay with my relatives so I had to take care of their 9-year-old son Tony when they’re not around. 

**（2）What and who**

Tony is a very energetic boy who is constantly shouting. Everyday after I picked him up from school he would refuse to do his homework and it’s quite a headache for me.
One night he stayed up late and kept on screaming so I allowed him to eat some ice cream before bed. Then the other morning he told me he’s got a heavy stomachache and claimed it was because of the ice cream. 

**（3）Why**

At ﬁrst I was really worried— I checked his temperature it looked normal, but he looked quite painful so I decided to take him to the hospital to be sure. 
After the doctor examined him and found nothing, I realized this little devil was trying to fool me…so I told him the doctor had to give him a further examination by putting a long thick tube inside him, and that’s going to be painful and noxious for many days. Of course he was intimidated by the idea then told me the truth he was faking it. 
I think his motivations to do that was pretty simple, he just didn’t want to go to school. He would rather spend the day in house and playing video game…maybe he thought I’m weaker to him than his parents so he might get away from it. But unfortunately he failed. 


### 13. Describe a success your friend has achieved

**（1）Who**

I would like to talk about my friend Zhenghao，who is two year younger than me and is my fellow student in the college.We knew each other from a school association on campus.

**（2）What success**

His most recent success in my memory was that he got an offer from the Fudan，which was a prestigious university in the China.Zhenghao was the most hardworking person I have met in school.

**（3）What did**

I remember when we were organizing different activities like school's speech competition，tree planting on the tree planting day and so on，he was one of the most passionate members.What made me feel quite impressed about him was his 100 percent determination and execution.No matter what idea has been made，he's always the pioneer to do it.Even though those extra-curricular activities took up a lot of his time，he was still a straight-A student in his grade，which made me so jealous.

Well,I don't think his successful application to this well-known university in the China is just luck. It's the large amount of effort and time he put behind the scenes to make things happen step by step that made him achieve this success. He is truly a man that I admire.
