### 1 | The definition of pain

&emsp;&emsp;Pain is a multidimensional experience that usually accompanies unpleasant feeling. The word "pain" originates from the Greek: poinē, meaning penalty. 

As an essential component of the body's defense system, pain provides a rapid warning to the central nervous system to quickly initiate a motor response to avoid actual or potential tissue damage.

### 2 | Two types of pain genetics

- One type of pain genetics asks the question, which genes are relevant to pain?

- The second type of pain genetics asks the question, of the pain-relevant genes, which are responsible for individual differences in sensitivity to pain and analgesia and for differential susceptibility and/or expression of painful pathologies?

### 3 | Two strategies to answer the questions

-  "Bottom-up" (genotype → phenotype)

-  "Top-down" (phenotype → genotype)

&emsp;&emsp;With a top-down strategy, one examines populations showing constrasting systems-level phenotypes and tries to find the genes responsible for the differences.

### 5 | Disease Genes versus Pain Genes

&emsp;&emsp;Genes that cause visible damage that gives rise to pain are called disease genes, while genes that affect pain processing, given a uniform damage, are called pain genes.

### 6 | Nociceptors

&emsp;&emsp;The basic function of nociceptors is to transmit information to higher-order neurons about tissue damage. Nociceptors are sensitive to multiple types of stimuli, such as noxious cold, noxious heat and high threshold mechanical stimuli as well as a variety of chemical mediators. However, not every nociceptor responds to each of the noxious stimuli. Several nociceptors with each being sensitive to a specific stimulus. There are several classes of nociceptors: mechanical, thermal, mechano-thermal, polymodal, and silent.

&emsp;&emsp;Mechanical nociceptors respond to intense pressure while thermal nociceptors respond to extreme hot or cold temperatures (>45°C or <5°C) and mechano-thermal nociceptors respond to both thermal and mechanical stimuli. Typically these three types of nociceptors have myelinated A fibers that conduct impulses at a velocity of 3 to 40 m/s. Collectively, these 3 types of nociceptors are called A(δ- β)-nociceptors.

&emsp;&emsp;Polymodal nociceptors respond to noxious mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli and typically have small, unmyelinated C fibers that conduct impulses at a velocity of less than 3 m/s.

&emsp;&emsp;The small, myelinated A(δ- β) fibers carry the nociceptive input responsible for the sharp pricking pain and the small, unmyelinated C fibers carry the nociceptive input responsible for the dull burning pain.

&emsp;&emsp;Silent nociceptors are activated by chemical stimuli (inflammatory mediators) and respond to mechanical and thermal stimuli only after they have been activated. These nociceptors also have small, unmyelinated C fibers that conduct impulses at a velocity of less than 3 m/s.

&emsp;&emsp;According to the conduction velocities, nociceptors could be classified as four types: the slowest conducting fibers are unmyelinated and designated C; the faster conducting myelinated fibers are designated Aδ, Aβ and Aα. A-fibers is described as causing a sharp pricking pain sensation and that of the C-fibers a dull, aching burning pain.

&emsp;&emsp;The widely held view that is presented in most present day textbooks is that only the smallest diameter and slowest conducting nerve fibers the C- and Aδ-fibers carry the afferent signal from nociceptors that is perceived as pain.

&emsp;&emsp;The signal from nociceptors is carried by unmyelinated C-fibers and myelinated A-fibers conducting in the A(δ-β) conduction velocity range. The C and A(δ-β) fibers also carry signals for non-noxious innocuous mechanical, warm and cold stimuli.

###  | Genomic technologies for pain genetics

In recent years, the field of human genetics has grown immensely in terms of data production and analysis, now routinely analysing data from thousands of people over millions of genetic markers and thousands of variables. Consequently, appropriate statistical methods are required to work with such large, multi-dimensional datasets.

In my talk, I will talk about a particular statistical tool called GWAS (genomewide association study), which have led us to discover the genetic basis ofmany important human characteristics for the first time. Most genetics studies are conducted on people of European ethnicity, in the UK, USA and Europe, but I had the opportunity of working with a mixed, multi-country cohort of Latin Americans, which allowed us to discover genes unique to othermajor ethnicities that contribute to the characteristic differences betweenour appearance. Interestingly, we could also establish statistical signaturesof contributions from our long-lost ancestors – the Neanderthals and Denisovan people. Finally, I will talk about my experience of working with a BBCdocumentary team about the real-life impact of our work.I will also talk about a few branches of this central theme. I’ll discuss some ofthe modifications of the corpus of GWAS tools that we are proposing. We’lllook into a branch of statistics called geometric morphometrics, and see howit is used to model our appearance. And lastly, we’ll see some of the medicalapplications, from pain to cancer.

The unprecedented power provided by current genomic technologies offers an extraordinary opportunity for a thorough assessment of the genetic basis of variation in pain sensitivity in the general human population. Although the application of these novel analysis tools for the study of complex human traits has focused mostly on disease phenotypes, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to examine phenotypic variation not directly related to disease. However, there is no published GWAS of experimental pain in humans. An important further drawback of GWAS conducted so far is that they have been mostly performed in populations of European ancestry, thus they have explored only a fraction of human phenotypic and genetic diversity. For instance, of special relevance for this proposal, recent studies in the US point to variable pain thresholds for European Americans, African Americans and Latinos. However, it is not clear if this variation relates to differences in neurobiological mechanisms or other, for instance social, factors. The study of populations with a mixed genetic ancestry provides additional technical advantages for the identification of genes involved in phenotypic variation. Two independent signals of gene localization can be exploited for mapping: allelic association and variation in ancestry along the genome. A standard GWAS exploits only allelic association and therefore has lower power. The availability of high-density chip genotyping enables the possibility of combining the signals of association and ancestry, characteristic of populations of mixed ancestry.

### Pain insensitivity

Lack of the ability to experience pain, as in the rare condition congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, can cause very serious health problems such as self-mutilation, auto-amputation, and corneal scarring.

### Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 

The DRG are comprised of the cell bodies of sensory neurons, and are located lateral to the spinal cord in the vertebral column. These sensory neurons have an axon that projects to peripheral tissues, such as the skin, and are responsible for our sensation of our bodies. The trigeminal ganglion is analogous to the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and is responsible for sensation in the face.

### pain perception

When oxious stimulus activating the terminals nociceptors, action potentials are propagated along the axons of the nociceptors into the spinal cord and the activity of one of the nociceptors is monitored by an intracellular electrode which impales its cell body which is located in thedorsal root ganglion (DRG).

### Pain thresholds

However, the genetic basis underlying variation in pain thresholds and how these thresholds change following tissue damage remains poorly understood.

### Findings from human pain genetics

Animal studies and the characterization of specific gene mutations in humans with Mendelian pain disorders have enabled the identification of a few gene variants with major effects on pain sensitivity.

### Heritability of pain in humans

Recent studies indicate that human sensitivity to pain has a complex multifactorial basis with heritability estimates of about 50%, depending on the modality of pain examined

### Pain genetics studies in the general population

However, research on the genetic basis of variation in sensitivity to pain in the general population is in its infancy.

#### Candidate gene studies

Candidate gene studies in experimental pain models and/or in people with chronic pain have implicated a number of gene variants, examples including enzymes involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators such as catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), GTP-cyclohydrolase (GCH1) and ion channels expressed in nociceptors (SCN9a) or immune cells (P2RX7). However, these findings have been difficult to replicate consistently, which may relate to technical aspects (such as small study samples), the complexity of the pain experience, and the possibility that variants may impact in a gender and modality specific manner.

### Importance

Elucidating the genetic basis of variation in pain sensitivity in the general human population is of great scientific importance. Understanding the genetic basis of pain will generate research outputs of fundamental biological significance: the neural substrates underlying pain are highly evolutionarily conserved and sensitisation within the nociceptive system provides important insight into ion channel/synaptic function and the operation of neural circuits. Understanding the fundamental biological pathways sub-serving pain also has translational potential in the form of novel analgesic targets - a major interest of the biotechnology industry. Such work could ultimately have an important impact on biomedicine in the form of improved pain management protocols and treatment tailored to an individual’s pain risk or resilience, including sensitivity differences between ethnic/racial groups.




### Hypersensitivity: hyperalgesia and allodynia

The properties of nociceptors considered so far were elucidated primarily from studies of uninjured tissue. However, intense noxious stimuli resulting in tissue damage often lead to an increase in the response to subsequent painful stimuli, called hypersensitivity, that is, an excessive sensitiveness or sensibility to pain. Hypersensitivity comprises both primary hypersensitivity, an increased sensitivity within the injured area predominantly due to peripheral nociceptor sensitization, and secondary hypersensitivity, an increased sensitivity in the surrounding uninjured area mediated centrally
