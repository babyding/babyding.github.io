### 5. Part2扩展方式

Helping point结构：直接回应+扩展信息

#### 5.1 What it is
（1）What it is-4分难度
	
	It’s a coffee maker.
	In response to the first question, what it is, it is a coffee maker. 


（2）What it is-6分难度

	It’s a dark green coloured machine so it looks very stylish in the kitchen. 
	It can make all sorts of coffee: latte, espresso, you name it. 

（3）What it is-7分难度

	The thing I bought is a semi-automatic coffee machine. 
	It means that I have to half of the work like putting water or grinding coffee beans.
	It supposes to be able to make more tasty coffee as it has higher pressure than other ones. 

#### 5.2 When and where you bought it

	I can’t really remember the exact time, 
	I think I got it from a shopping mall a few weeks ago 
	when I was waiting for my friend there, 
	the salesman made a really good speech about it.

#### 5.3 Why you bought it

	The reason is pretty straightforward—I love drinking coffee. 
	I have at least two cups everyday so I thought with this machine at home 
	I could save some money by making coffee on my own.  

#### 5.4 Summary point

（1）原因1+故事1

	However, I didn’t anticipate that this expensive machine 
	is going to sit there and eat dust on my shelf. 
	The biggest reason is that it takes me ages to complete one drink. 

（2）原因1+故事1

	However, I didn’t anticipate that this expensive machine 
	is going to sit there and eat dust on my shelf. 
	The biggest reason is that it takes me ages to make one coffee. 
	It’s a semi-automatic machine so that I have to grind the coffee beans, 
	switch the bar under the device, and set the temperature all by myself! 
	Not mentioning I have to clean the machine after making a coffee. 
	It will take me much less time if I use a capsule coffee maker.  
	I usually make coffee in the morning so there’s absolutely no way I can make it on time. 

（3）原因2+故事2

	The other reason is that the taste is not even that good. 
	I tried many times, even changed different coffee beans but the feeling is still unsatisfying. 
	I think I can get much better quality coffee at Starbucks. 
	So that’s the reason why I don’t use this machine often.
