### Pain

&emsp;&emsp;Pain is a multidimensional experience that exhibits considerable variability and subjectivity compared to other sensory modalities. , pain offers organisms the ability to detect and respond to aversive stimuli. The word "pain" originates from the Greek: poinē, meaning penalty. As a fundamental evolutionary adaptation, pain provides a rapid warning to the central nervous system to quickly initiate a motor response to avoid actual or potential tissue damage.

### Pain as a clinical and societal problem

By a variety of metrics, pain is the leading source of morbidity worldwide. For example, in a recent survey of the frequency of initial presenting complaints to family physicians, back pain, abdominal pain, sore throat, headache, and leg pain were included in the top ten. Among the ten most prevalent groups of diseases are joint disorders (including osteoarthritis), back pain, and headache. Costs related to the treatment of and lost productivity from chronic pain tallied $600 billion in the United States in 2011 (IOM 2011), higher than the budget of the Department of Defense and exceeding costs related to heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined. Most important perhaps are the years lived with disability calculations of the World Health Organization’s Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Initiative, which in
2017 ranked four chronic pain states among the top ten causes: back pain (#1), headache (#2), musculoskeletal disorders (#5), and neck pain (#6) (GBD 2017 Dis. Inj. Incidence Preval. Collab. 2018).

### Pain perception

&emsp;&emsp;Pain perception is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of environmental and genetic factors.

&emsp;&emsp;When oxious stimulus activating the terminals nociceptors, action potentials are propagated along the axons of the nociceptors into the spinal cord and the activity of one of the nociceptors is monitored by an intracellular electrode which impales its cell body which is located in thedorsal root ganglion (DRG).

### Disease genes versus pain genes

&emsp;&emsp;Genes that cause visible damage that gives rise to pain are called disease genes, while genes that affect pain processing, given a uniform damage, are called pain genes.

### Pain genetics

**(1)Two types of Pain genetics**

- One type of pain genetics asks the question, which genes are relevant to pain?

- The second type of pain genetics asks the question, of the pain-relevant genes, which are responsible for individual differences in sensitivity to pain and analgesia and for differential susceptibility and/or expression of painful pathologies?

**(2)Two strategies to answer the questions**

-  "Bottom-up" (genotype → phenotype)

-  "Top-down" (phenotype → genotype)

&emsp;&emsp;With a top-down strategy, one examines populations showing constrasting systems-level phenotypes and tries to find the genes responsible for the differences.

### Individual differences in pain

Pain is an immense clinical and societal challenge, and the key to understanding and treating it is variability. Robust interindividual differences are consistently observed in pain sensitivity, susceptibility to developing painful disorders, and response to analgesic manipulations.

I have long argued that individual differences are the key to understanding chronic pain (Mogil 1999, 2012a; Mogil et al. 1996). The foundational question animating all of pain research would seem to be “What causes chronic pain?” I would submit that a more productive question is actually “What causes chronic pain to develop in a few unlucky people, while everyone else heals up just fine?”

In some instances and in some people, intensely noxious stimuli are not reported as causing pain, whereas others can experience excruciating pain from light touching of the skin. Some people are highly sensitive to pain relief from placebo administration, while others are insensitive to even high doses of morphine.

&emsp;&emsp;Pain perception, as well as sensitivity and tolerance to pain, vary widely among individuals. Pain sensitivity, defined as the proneness to react to standardized experimental or pathological stimuli, varies widely between subjects. 

&emsp;&emsp;Pain ratings of seemingly identical noxious stimuli may range from “no pain” to “excruciating” pain. Pain sensitivity is determined by complex interactions between ethnic, psychophysical, psychological, genetic, and social factors.


Pain sensitivity varies substantially among humans. A significant part of the human population develops chronic pain conditions that are characterized by heightened pain sensitivity.

&emsp;&emsp;Sensitivity to pain varies considerably between individuals and is known to be heritable. Robust individual differences in pain sensitivity has been observed, and recent evidence suggests that some of the variability may be genetically mediated. Some individuals seem to be highly sensitive to pain, whereas others seem to be surprisingly insensitive. 

&emsp;&emsp;Large individual differences in pain sensitivity present a challenge for medical diagnosis and may be of importance for the development of chronic pain. Variance in pain sensitivity is partially mediated by genetic factors, but the extent of this contribution is uncertain.

&emsp;&emsp;Ethnic differences in pain sensitivity have been widely reported（待补充

Increased sensitivity to experimental pain is a risk factor for developing chronic pain, a common and debilitating but poorly understood symptom.

Recent studies in the US point to variable pain thresholds for European Americans, African Americans and Latinos.

Large individual differences in pain sensitivity can complicate diagnosis and pain treatment and can confound clinical trials.

 As it has been shown repeatedly that high acute pain sensitivity is a risk factor for developing chronic pain.

### GWAS

#### Advantages

&emsp;&emsp;In recent years, the field of human genetics has grown immensely in terms of data production and analysis, now routinely analysing data from thousands of people over millions of genetic markers and thousands of variables. Consequently, appropriate statistical methods are required to work with such large, multi-dimensional datasets.

&emsp;&emsp;The unprecedented power provided by current genomic technologies offers an extraordinary opportunity for a thorough assessment of the genetic basis of variation in pain sensitivity in the general human population. 

&emsp;&emsp;There is a particular statistical tool called GWAS (Genome-wide association study), which have led us to discover the genetic basis of many important human characteristics for the first time.

&emsp;&emsp;Although the application of these novel analysis tools for the study of complex human traits has focused mostly on disease phenotypes, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to examine phenotypic variation not directly related to disease.

### Animal studies

Animal studies and the characterization of specific gene mutations in humans with Mendelian pain disorders have enabled the identification of a few gene variants with major effects on pain sensitivity.

A number of approaches to pain sensitivity genetics have been adopted including the examination of rare (monogenic) syndromes of pain insensitivity and candidate genes identified from transcriptional profiling in animal models. Candidate gene studies in humans with chronic pain have been unconvincing, and confirmed candidate gene associations are still lacking.

Even though animal studies have provided a list of candidate ‘pain genes’, only a few genes have been identified that are associated with the perception of pain in humans.

### Candidate gene studies

Candidate gene studies in experimental pain models and/or in people with chronic pain have implicated a number of gene variants, examples including enzymes involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators such as catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), GTP-cyclohydrolase (GCH1) and ion channels expressed in nociceptors (SCN9a) or immune cells (P2RX7).

However, these findings have been difficult to replicate consistently, which may relate to technical aspects (such as small study samples), the complexity of the pain experience, and the possibility that variants may impact in a gender and modality specific manner.



#### SCN9A


#### OPRM1

#### P4502D6

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that code for melanocortin-1 receptor and neuronal cytochrome P4502D6 are associated with alterations in opioid analgesia in humans.

#### Congenital insensitivity to pain

Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) type I has been linked to the gene encoding a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, and CIP type IV has been linked to the gene encoding for a nerve growth factor-specific tyrosine kinase receptor.

#### COMT

Furthermore, a common SNP in codon 158 ( val158met ) of the gene that codes for catecholamine- O -methyltransferase (COMT) has been proposed to contribute to differences in the human experience of pain

### CANDELA cohort

&emsp;&emsp;a mixed, multi-country cohort of Latin Americans, which allowed us to discover genes unique to other major ethnicities that contribute to the characteristic differences between our appearance. 

The study of populations with a mixed genetic ancestry provides additional technical advantages for the identification of genes involved in phenotypic variation. Two independent signals of gene localization can be exploited for mapping: allelic association and variation in ancestry along the genome. A standard GWAS exploits only allelic association and therefore has lower power. The availability of high-density chip genotyping enables the possibility of combining the signals of association and ancestry, characteristic of populations of mixed ancestry.

### Gap and questions

**(1)Difficult to replicate consistently**

However, the findings from candidate gene studies have been difficult to replicate consistently, which may relate to technical aspects (such as small study samples), the complexity of the pain experience, and the possibility that variants may impact in a gender and modality specific manner

**(2)genetic basis poorly understood**

The genetic basis underlying variation in pain thresholds and how these thresholds change following tissue damage remains poorly understood. Research on the genetic basis of variation in sensitivity to pain in the general population is in its infancy. There is no published GWAS of experimental pain in the general human population.

**(3)Most in Europeans**

&emsp;&emsp;Most genetics studies are conducted on people of European ethnicity, in the UK, USA and Europe（待补充）

&emsp;&emsp;An important further drawback of GWAS conducted so far is that they have been mostly performed in populations of European ancestry, thus they have explored only a fraction of human phenotypic and genetic diversity.

**(4)Other factors**

However, it is not clear if this variation relates to differences in neurobiological mechanisms or other, for instance social, factors.

**(5)Limit inferences made from animal models**

There are also major differences between species that limit inferences made from animal models (pain in humans results from a complex sensory, affective, and cognitive factors).

### Heritability

Recent studies indicate that human sensitivity to pain has a complex multifactorial basis with heritability estimates of about 50%, depending on the modality of pain examined

Chronic pain conditions as well as experimentally induced pain have been shown to have a considerable genetic component. Twin studies have shown observed heritabilities of about 50% for different pain traits.

Although the relative importance of genetic versus environmental factors in human pain perception remains unclear, reported heritability for nociceptive and analgesic sensitivities in mice is estimated to range from 28 to 76%.

---

### Importance and novelty

Elucidating the genetic basis of variation in pain sensitivity in the general human population is of great scientific importance.

**(1)Predictive parameters of pain sensitivity**

Investigating the predictive parameters of pain sensitivity could therefore be of potential medical interest and have significant implications both for the health care system and for pharmaceutical research.

**(2)Genetic basis**

Understanding the genetic basis of pain will generate research outputs of fundamental biological significance: the neural substrates underlying pain are highly evolutionarily conserved and sensitisation within the nociceptive system provides important insight into ion channel/synaptic function and the operation of neural circuits. 

**(3)Fundamental biological pathways**

Understanding the fundamental biological pathways sub-serving pain also has translational potential in the form of novel analgesic targets - a major interest of the biotechnology industry.

**(4)Pain management**

Such work could ultimately have an important impact on biomedicine in the form of improved pain management protocols and treatment tailored to an individual’s pain risk or resilience, including sensitivity differences between ethnic/racial groups.

Genetic factors might affect variations of opiate sensitivity. More precise studies on the relationship between gene polymorphisms and opiate sensitivity will enable realization of personalized pain treatment by predicting opiate sensitivity and requirement for each patient.

**(5)Prediction of pain sensitivity**

Measures of pain sensitivity are predictive of acute postoperative pain, and there is preliminary evidence that heightened pain sensitivity increases risk for future chronic pain conditions. At this time, however, it is unclear which experimental pain modalities should be used as predictors for future pain conditions. Careful assessment of each individual's pain sensitivity may become invaluable for the prevention, evaluation, and treatment of pain.

Prediction of pain sensitivity has been used preoperatively as a measure to prevent development of severe acute pain and to attenuate its transition to persistent postsurgical pain. In addition, prediction of experimental pain sensitivity prior to testing of analgesic drug efficacy may theoretically reduce the high attrition rate for new drug candidates by allowing initial testing in groups of high-pain and low-pain responders.

Pain sensitivity may also be of great importance for the development of clinical pain. Thus, assessment of pain sensitivity may be relevant for the prevention, evaluation, and treatment of acute and chronic pain.

**(6)Targets for novel therapies**

Chronic widespread pain is a complex clinical problem. Identification of underlying genetic factors would shed light on the biology of pain and offer targets for novel therapies.

**(7)Prediction of chronic pain**

The use of human genetics for identification of intrinsic factors that contribute to chronic pain states is attractive for several reasons.

**(8)people can report pain perception**

Studying the genetic basis of pain in humans, as opposed to animal models, has the advantage that people can report pain perception directly while animal studies require behavioural endpoints to nociceptive stimuli.

### Pain modalities

The genetic and environmental factors that influence pain sensitivity differ across pain modalities.

### Quantitative sensory testing

Pain sensitivity can be estimated only through the use of well-controlled experimental pain stimuli.

Experimental pain studies in healthy humans (Quantitative Sensory Testing, QST) also have important advantages over studies in disease cohorts. Particularly, pain variation during disease could be due to the severity of the disease process itself, or its treatment, thus greatly complicating analyses. By contrast, in QST studies one applies stimuli in standard conditions, controlling for intensity, location and duration to evaluate baseline pain sensitivity. Additionally, it is possible to perform a standard sensitisation with algogens (e.g. UVB burn, thermal burn, mustard oil or capsaicin injection) as controlled models of tissue injury.


Historically, pain sensitivity has been defined as the difference between threshold and tolerance, but this definition is problematic. Thresholds are generally insensitive to analgesic manipulations and are subject to significant response biases, whereas tolerance is highly dependent on the motivation of the subject.

QST provide a simple, yet straightforward way to characterize pain sensitivity.

examining a patient's basal pain sensitivity and the pain he or she experiences after a clinical manipulation

Attempts to standardise and quantify pain sensibility in humans have led to the introduction of standardised thermal, mechanical or chemical stimuli that activate the nociceptive (pain signalling) system. Such quantitative sensory testing (QST) has been used to show that an individual's sensitivity to experimental pain predicts risk of developing chronic pain after surgical interventions such as hernia repair and arthroscopy. That pre-operative pain sensitivity is a major risk factor for chronic post-operative pain suggests that exploration of genetic variation underlying experimental pain might be a useful approach.

### Materials and methods

A total of 1963 healthy young adults from Columbia underwent multiple experimental pain modalities (thermal, pressure, ischemic, cold pressor).

#### Pain sensitivity phenotyping

**(1)Applying health questionnaires**

**(2)QST of baseline somatosensory function**

**(3)QST of sensitised somatosensory function**

#### Genotyping







### Aims

**(1)Obtain QST data**

Obtain QST data for at least 2,000 healthy individuals. We will obtain Illumina GSA chip genotypes in the research subjects. 

**(2)Perform GWAS**

Perform a GWAS for QST phenotypes in relation to both baseline pain thresholds and sensitisation induced by the algogen mustard oil (allyl-isothiocyanate - AITC). We will perform univariate and multivariate analyses using local ancestry-based and population association tests, allowing for kinship and population structure within mixed linear models. These analyses will allow a direct assessment of the reported ethno-racial differences in QST phenotypes.

**(3)Analysis plans**

We will then perform tissue and cell-specific analyses aimed at: (i) identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (ii) characterizing differential gene expression patterns, and (iii) performing combined genomic and transcriptomic analyses, including, co-localization of GWAS and eQTL hits and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). Further downstream analyses will include testing for the enrichment of GWAS hits in tissue and cell-type specific genome regulatory annotations and gene/regulatory pathway/network analyses.



To understand mechanisms underlying pain sensitivity and to search for common gene variants (MAF>5%) influencing pain sensitivity, we explored the genetic variation in individuals' responses to experimental pain. Quantitative sensory testing to heat pain was performed in 1963 volunteers from Columbia. A combination of methods was used to test the association between genetic markers and pain sensitivity, and the function of the genes identified was explored using network analysis.

In the present study, we sought to determine whether rare variants associate with extremes of pain sensitivity in healthy volunteers.

This study was performed to evaluate genetic influences on variability in human pain sensitivity. Pain sensitivity in response to experimental painful thermal and cold stimuli was measured with visual analogue scale ratings
