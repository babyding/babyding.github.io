### 1. Describe a time you taught something new to a younger person

**（1）When**

&emsp;&emsp;The experience I am going to tell you happened during last summer vacation.I returned from the university and had nothing to do at home.I was bored to death and desperately wanted to find something to occupy my endless free time.

**（2）What, who and why**

&emsp;&emsp;Then，my little brother，a boy who just entered secondary school，became interested in badminton after watching some matches played by Lindan，the best badminton player aroundthe world，and wanted to learn.Since I had received professional badminton training，this article is from laokaoya websie，I thought maybe I could teach him.In this way，he could save the money to employ a coach and I got a good way to kill the time.It was a win-win situation.

&emsp;&emsp;We bought a racket and found a badminton court near his home.Everything was ready.Every morning at 8o'clock，we met at the court and began our training session.I showed him how to move his feet，aim at the shuttlecock and swing the racket.He was very talented and progressed pretty fast.After a month，he could play several rounds with me.

**（3）How**

&emsp;&emsp;I really like this teaching experience.It enhanced our relationship.We are much closer after that.Meanwhile，I obtain a sense of achievement from his progress.

### 2. Describe a time you received horrible service

**（1）When, where, who and what**

&emsp;&emsp;A time I received horrible service was actually from a property agent in Yangzhou.

&emsp;&emsp;It happened on a weekend last month at my rental apartment.I remember that it was raining that day and I was busy working in my laboratory as usual.When I got home from work，my room was like a disaster，you know a lot of water leaked in from the window and the ceiling.I asked my roommate about what was happened and he told me that it was probably because the ceiling had a fissure that let the rain water come in.He also told me that he had called the agent but there's was nobody coming to fix it.

&emsp;&emsp;So，I dialed the number of the agent again and was told that they had already arranged a professional and promised me to solve this problem.My roommate and I thought this time this matter would be done soon，but they disappointed us again.This article is from Laokaoya website.Nobody showed up the following days.What's quite annoying for us was that it keptraining cats and dogs for many days，which was normal in summer Beijing，but we had nothing to do except for waiting.

&emsp;&emsp;Later on，we've found that it's because the repairing professional was quite busy to take the job，and the property agent still wanted to make some profits between us，so they gave a false promise to put it off.

**（2）why**

&emsp;&emsp;The reason why I think the service from the property agent was horrible was that the agent was acting so unprofessionally，you know，they should have informed us of the real situation so that we could reduce the cost to the minimum.

### 3. Describe a time when you looked for information from the internet

**(1)When**

&emsp;&emsp;Well, as far as I can remember, the last time I looked for information online was when I prepared for my trip to Chongqing. I went to Chongqing for vacation last month, so I had to plan everything prior to my upcoming trip so I would not be disoriented when I got there.

**(2)What**

&emsp;&emsp;The information I looked for was our accommodation choices, good food, tourist attractions and safety information in Chongqing. All of those information was of vital importance to prepare for a wonderful traveling experience.

&emsp;&emsp;I used Google to search the information coz the results are more reliable and various than other search engines. Also, I found a lot of information on Xiecheng, a major tourism-related website that provides tips and suggestions for international travelers.

**(3)How**

&emsp;&emsp;As for how I felt about it, it was really convenient for me to find what I need without leaving my house. I could know a lot of things about Chongqing while searching for information to prepare for my trip. I was very grateful that I could get assess to the Internet, which made me feel really confident and well-prepared for my trip.

### 4. Describe a success your friend has achieved

**（1）Who**

&emsp;&emsp;I would like to talk about my friend Zhenghao，who is two year younger than me and is my fellow student in the college.We knew each other from a school association on campus.

**（2）What success**

&emsp;&emsp;His most recent success in my memory was that he got an offer from the Fudan，which was a prestigious university in the China.Zhenghao was the most hardworking person I have met in school.

**（3）What did**

&emsp;&emsp;I remember when we were organizing different activities like school's speech competition，knowledge contest and so on，he was one of the most passionate members.What made me feel quite impressed about him was his 100 percent determination and execution.No matter what idea has been made，he's always the pioneer to do it.Even though those activities took up a lot of his time，he was still a straight-A student in his grade，which made me so jealous.

&emsp;&emsp;Well,I don't think his successful application to this well-known university in the China is just luck. It's the large amount of effort and time he put behind the scenes to make things happen step by step that made him achieve this success. He is truly a man that I admire.

### 5. Describe a time that someone didn' t tell you the whole truth about something

**（1）When**

&emsp;&emsp;The time that I almost got tricked was the time my cousin tried to fool me. Last year I had a short stay with my relatives so I had to take care of their 9-year-old son Zhenghao when they’re not around. 

**（2）What and who**

&emsp;&emsp;Zhenghao is a very energetic boy who is constantly shouting. Everyday after I picked him up from school he would refuse to do his homework and it’s quite a headache for me.One night he stayed up late and kept on screaming so I allowed him to eat some ice cream before bed. Then the other morning he told me he’s got a heavy stomachache and claimed it was because of the ice cream. 

**（3）Why**

&emsp;&emsp;At ﬁrst I was really worried— I checked his temperature it looked normal, but he looked quite painful so I decided to take him to the hospital to be sure. After the doctor examined him and found nothing, I realized this little devil was trying to fool me…so I told him the doctor had to give him a further examination by putting a long thick tube inside him, and that’s going to be painful for many days. Of course he was intimidated by the idea then told me the truth he was faking it. 

&emsp;&emsp;I think his motivations to do that was pretty simple, he just didn’t want to go to school. He would rather spend the day in house and playing video game…maybe he thought I’m weaker to him than his parents so he might get away from it. But unfortunately he failed. 

### 6. Describe a time that you had to change your plan or change your mind

**(1)When**

&emsp;&emsp;The thing that I had to change my plan happened in my senior high school.Back then I was faced with the problem of the division of arts and sciences.According to the Chinese educational system，everyone had to choose one as his or her major and this would affect the subjects he or she took in the university entrance exam. At that time, I was interested in arts, so wanted to chose to study geography，politics，and history.

**(2)What made you change and new plan**

&emsp;&emsp;However, I was still so confused and did not know which one is better，so I went to my teacher and asked for her advice.As I was good at all the subjects，she suggested me to choose the sciences.She said that at this stage of my life，I would not know what I wanted to do in the future.If I had chosen the sciences，I could still change into arts degrees in the university.But if I had chosen the arts，it would almost be impossible to study the sciences because of the lack of background knowledge.I thought her words did make a sense and followed her advice.

**(3)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;It turned out that I had made a good decision. When I chose the universities and majors after the exam,I could choose almost whatever I want.I am really grateful to my teacher.

### 7. Describe a party that you joined

**(1)What kind, where and when**

&emsp;&emsp;The most memorable party in my life should be the party that we held last year. It was held to celebrate our reunion after we went to university. And It was held in my friend’s home. A lot of my high school classmates attended the party. I arrived at my classmate's home very early to help him prepare the dinner.

&emsp;&emsp;Since most of us hadn’t seen each other for nearly four years after our graduation from the high school, we were really excited to know each other’s status quo.

&emsp;&emsp;After the meal, we played cards, sang songs, and chatted with each other to exchange our wonderful experiences and so on. Later, we went to KTV to sing songs. We were screaming and laughing, and a lot of us got drunk. 

**(2)Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;It was really awesome, and we made a decision to have that kind of get-together every half a year.

### 8. Describe a time you enjoyed your free time

**（1）When and where**

&emsp;&emsp;A time I enjoyed my free time was in Chongqing，a city located in the southwest of China and surrounded by mountains. My girlfriend and I went to Chongqing for a trip last month. It's quite far from here，and I remember it took us around 10 hours to get to there，which made me exhausted.But the moment I got out of the train，I felt a sense of relief. Maybe it's because I needed some fresh air at that time，or it's the nice taxi driver that made me feel so.

**（2）What did**

The city is famous for two things，its food and landscape.Hotpot is the representative of the citys food，which is hot and spicy. So the first day we didn't visit some big scenic spots there but just toured around the area where we were staying and had a hotpot.The city's landscape is also unique, so the followings days were quite exciting. We visited the sanxia，and the hongyadong，which were all my favorites.


**(3)feel**

&emsp;&emsp;You know，I was quite into this place，not only because the trip to Chongqing gave me a chance to escape from my work and life，but also was a precious opportunity for me to get to experience an interesting culture there.

&emsp;&emsp;I wish I could have had more free time to stay in this place！

### 9. Describe a situation when you don't have enough time

**（1）What**

&emsp;&emsp;Something I desire to do but don't have time to do is snorkeling.

**（2）How difficult**

&emsp;&emsp;Snorkeling is kind of a practice for real swimming in the sea, and it is a kind of dangerous sport to newbies. Before snorkeling , you need to accept a training course in a small swimming pool to conquer the fear. You would be equipped with a kind of diving mask with a long tube that enables you to breathe the air in the water.You need to practice every single step time and time again , and it would take you alomost three hours.

**（3）Why**

&emsp;&emsp;One of the biggest reasons why I want to learn the snorkeling is that I hope one day I could join with my friend Zhenghao who is a snorkeling lover so that we could have more adventures in the sea.Plus，I am quite into sea creatures，which are the cuties animals to me.

**（4）Why**

&emsp;&emsp;You know，right now I'm concentrating on my own studies in school，and it's about one more year to finish.At least，in this coming school year，I wouldn't be able to make this little dream come true.But，hopefully，I could go to Thailand to learn that training course after my graduation.

### 10. Describe an occasion when you got up early

**（1）What, when and why**

&emsp;&emsp;I’d like to talk about the experience when I had to get up super early to catch the bus. It happened during my final year of university when I got a paid job as an waiter at a restaurant.

&emsp;&emsp;On the first day of my job, I had to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning considering that the workplace was 1 hour away from my school by bus.
Moreover, there were so many traffic congestions during the rush hours, which had seriously pissed me off a lot of times before. Therefore, I decided to wake up relatively early to take the first bus to work.

**（1）Feel**

&emsp;&emsp;I was a night owl, not an early bird. In most days, I was normally up at around 7 o’clock, so getting up at 5 was a pretty big change to the routine.  I actually set two alarms just to make sure that I wouldn’t sleep in and get late. But strangely enough, I woke up by myself, completely naturally, just before the alarm’s about to go off!

&emsp;&emsp;As for how I felt about getting up early, I was that excited! 
I wasn’t really feeling that tired at all, because I was so looking forward to the first day of the paid job. Also, it was quite a nice feeling getting up before dawn because the surrounding was quiet and peaceful, and the roads were virtually empty, which made a nice change!
