**举例：**

**答案1：**
	
	For people who needs to broaden their circles 
	I guess learning a new language is the best path to take.. 观点A 

	As they get to know more people from different backgrounds.
	so that they can make friends and develop new relationships.解释A

	it’s not necessary to learn a new language观点B. 

	Like many traditional industries don’t need to deal with foreign language speaker. 解释B

	So I don’t think it’s the same for everyone. 总结

	Personally I think language is a powerful tool to communicate, 
	so I would say it’s necessary to learn it, 
	because it broadens people’s circles.. 观点A 

	As they can make connections across different industries. 解释A 
	Those connections can bring benefit to people’s life and work. 

	But for others who are satisfied with their life 
	it’s not necessary to learn a new language观点B

#### 5.3 Solution

- Analyze the problem+Solution A+Explain A+Conclusion  (Speculation)  

**举例：**

How can children be encouraged to study art? 

	I think the reason that caused the lack of interests in art subjects 
	is because there’s no enough resources provides to children. 

	So I think the government should begin with building more 
	art facilities in the city like galleries and art ..

	it’s a good way to help children to develop interests in art, 
	learn things they can’t learn from the book.

- 分析现状+将来的猜测A+分析A

**举例：**

	Given that the level of congestions is surprisingly high 
	I think the government will do something to solve it. 现状分析

	I would expect By the end of 2030, 
	big cities like Beijing and Shanghai will have built a complete transportation system. 将来的猜测A 

	In the next stage,

	connecting the outskirt of the city to the central area. 分析A
