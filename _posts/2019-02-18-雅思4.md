## 第四部分 深度问答题思路与拓展1


### 1. 什么是Part3问答题

#### 1.1 Part3怎么考

- Show your ability to give opinions, and justify your opinion.  

（1）Part3 demo-5分

	What do you think of buying medicines online?
	
	I think it’s good..Because it’s more convenient…people don’t have to go out.

（2）Part3 demo-5分
	
	What do you think of buying medicines online?
	
	As far as I’m concerned this’s such a complicated issue 
	so I think it depends on different situation. 
	If you buy medicines online it’s convenient 
	but it’s also dangerous because there’re fake medicines.  
	But maybe for people who live far away from the drug store 
	it’s a good idea to buy drugs online. 

（3）Part3 demo-6分

	What do you think of buying medicines online?
	
	Generally… I think it’s a good thing, because it’s quite convenient. 
	Like people live far away from the shop they can get medicines easier. 
	Also it can be cheaper than the store. 

（4）Part3 demo-7分

	What do you think of buying medicines online?

	I think it’s time-saving.
	Like when people live far away from the city, 
	if they are ill or caught up with some diseases, 
	it might take them a long time to go to a hospital
	So being able to buy medicines online is a good idea, 
	saves them the distance to travel.

**举例1：Communication skill is important.**
	
	Knowing how to talk to people is important...
	It helps to extend better human connections, 
	and it can bring people all kinds of benefits in life and work. 

**举例2：Protecting old building is important.**

	Allocating enough money and resources to refurbish and 
	keep old buildings in a city, 
	is a good way to help to preserve the cultural identity of the city.

#### 6.1 Part3核心结构-Opinion

**（观点要General）**

Opinion-两种形式

- 1.Reason-观点题

	What kind of lifestyle is suitable to people in modern society?
- 2.Statement-描述题
 
	Would you say that people have enough leisure time today?

**举例：**

	Would you say people are having enough leisure time in your country?
	
	观点A
	I think it depends. 
	People who don’t need to worry about money would have longer holidays, 
	but people who need to work might relax less. 
	And Chinese people don’t really like to take holidays 
	coz they need to spend the time support their families..

	观点B 
	I would say the majority of the Chinese don’t have enough leisure time 
	coz Chinese society value hard work a lot.  

	观点C
	Absolutely not! 
	Most Chinese working classes don’t enjoy the luxury of enjoying much leisure time 
	as the social welfare system doesn’t allow them to do so.

#### 6.2 Part3核心结构-Explain

**Explain (理论+例子证明观点)**

- Process 解释过程
- Comparison 比较别人
- Effect 预测结果

**举例：**

	Would you say people are having enough leisure time in your country?

	A
	I would say the majority of the Chinese don’t have enough leisure time 
	coz Chinese society value hard work a lot.  
	解释过程(理论/例子结合)

	B
	It is common to see people give up on their spare time to work more or study more. 
	Employees who sacrifice their leisure time would get promoted easier; 
	students who take extra classes at the weekend 
	are more likely to get into a good university. 

	C
	Absolutely not! 
	Most Chinese working classes don’t enjoy the luxury of enjoying much leisure time 
	as the social welfare system doesn’t allow them to do so. （比较）

	D
	Compare to the country like the UK, 
	Chinese citizens don’t enjoy many social benefits like pensions or free medical care. 
	If someone is out of the job, 
	it would be devastated for the person as well as for the family. 
	So employees would spend as much time as possible 
	to work and to save more money for the future.

#### 6.3 Part3核心结构-Example

**Example-具体化到组织/个体等**

- Data/Fact –提升专业度
- Speculation
- Solution / methods 

**举例：**

	Would you say people are having enough leisure time in your country?

	Taken a survey I’ve seen on the economist as an example, 
	people in China works more than 44 hours every week, 
	it’s like the longest hour working hour in the world. 
	Not mentioning that people have to commute, 
	or working extra at the weekends.

#### 6.4 Part3核心结构Conclusion

Conclusion-两种形式

- 1.结束话题
	So I don’t think Chinese people have much leisure time.
- 2.引出新话题
	I think it is not healthy for people to be this obsessed with works. 

**（1）Part3核心结构6分**

	I would say the majority of the Chinese don’t have enough leisure time 
	coz Chinese people worry a lot about their future.  
	
	Like last time I’ve seen a survey, 
	Chinese work the longest hour in the world. 
	They need to worry about their pensions, medical care and other things, 
	
	so they have to spend long time working and saving money.

**（2）Part3核心结构6.5分**

	I would say the majority of the Chinese don’t have enough leisure time coz 
	Chinese society value hard work a lot.
	
	It is common to see people give up on their spare time to work more or study more. 
	Employees who sacrifice their leisure time would get promoted easier; 
	students who take extra classes at the weekend 
	are more likely to get into a good university. 
	
	But I don’t think it’s healthy to work too long. 

**（3）Part3核心结构7分**

	Absolutely not! 
	Most Chinese working classes don’t enjoy the luxury of enjoying much leisure time 
	as the social welfare system doesn’t allow them to do so.

	Compare to the country like the UK, Chinese citizens don’t enjoy much social benefit like pensions or free medical care.
